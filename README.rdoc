    packets and adapts based on the success rate of packets sent

  PLOrk - variations on the PLOrk classic CliX implemented using different
    networking protocols and a tester used to test networking during a
    gathering of the entire Princeton Laptop Orchestra

  test-std - LOrkNeT test code to evalute networking conditions in your
   laptop orchestra without the use of NTP

  test-ntp -  LOrkNeT test code to evalute networking conditions in your
   laptop orchestra using NTP

  tOSC - a modified version of OSC written in ChucK that forwardly synchronizes
    packets sent over OSC

TODO:
  1) Work on getting NTP configured properly on computers using the 
     test-ntp test
